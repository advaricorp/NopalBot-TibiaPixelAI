## üéØ Bypass Techniques

### 1. **OBS Game Capture Method**
*Based on TibiaAuto12 approach*

```python
# OBS Game Capture bypass
def obs_game_capture_bypass():
    """
    Uses OBS Studio to capture game content without detection
    - OBS Game Capture hooks DirectX/OpenGL
    - Bypass anti-screenshot because OBS is "legitimate"
    - Capture from secondary window
    """
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Legitimate software (OBS)
- ‚úÖ Stable capture
- ‚úÖ Low detection risk
- ‚úÖ Works with DirectX/OpenGL

**Implementation:**
- Configure OBS Game Capture
- Capture from window behind Tibia
- Use OBS as intermediary

### 2. **Matrix-Based Capture**
*Based on PyTibia approach*

```python
# Matrix-based screenshot bypass
def matrix_screenshot_bypass():
    """
    Uses matrix calculations for ultra-fast capture
    - Matrix calculations for optimization
    - Parallelism for multiple simultaneous captures
    - Pre-processing to reduce latency
    """
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Ultra-fast processing
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution
- ‚úÖ Optimized algorithms
- ‚úÖ Low CPU usage

### 3. **Hybrid OBS + Matrix Approach**
*Our innovative combination*

```python
# Hybrid bypass combining both approaches
class OBSMatrixBypass:
    def capture_matrix_parallel(self):
        # Parallel capture methods
        capture_methods = [
            self._capture_matrix_direct,
            self._capture_matrix_obs,
            self._capture_matrix_mss,
            self._capture_matrix_win32
        ]
        
        # Execute captures in parallel
        futures = []
        for method in capture_methods:
            future = self.executor.submit(method)
            futures.append(future)
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. **Simple Working Bypass**
```python
class SimpleWorkingBypass:
    def capture_simple_working(self):
        methods = [
            ('Screen DC', self._capture_screen_dc),
            ('Window DC Special', self._capture_window_dc_special),
            ('Desktop DC', self._capture_desktop_dc),
            ('Fallback Simple', self._capture_fallback_simple)
        ]
```

#### 2. **Advanced Screenshot Engine**
```python
class AdvancedScreenshotBypass:
    def capture_advanced(self):
        # Multiple bypass techniques
        # Hardware acceleration
        # Memory-based capture
        # Direct framebuffer access
```

#### 3. **Community Bypass Research**
```python
class CommunityBypass:
    def capture_community_methods(self):
        # Research from community
        # Experimental techniques
        # Novel approaches
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Detection Measures

### 1. **Timing-Based Detection**
```python
def detect_debugger_timing():
    start_time = get_high_res_time()
    # Perform operations
    end_time = get_high_res_time()
    elapsed = end_time - start_time
    
    if elapsed > 0.001:  # 1ms threshold
        return True  # Debugger detected
```

### 2. **Hardware Breakpoint Detection**
```python
def detect_hardware_breakpoints():
    # Check debug registers
    # Detect hardware breakpoints
    # Identify debugging tools
```

### 3. **Process Environment Analysis**
```python
def detect_debug_environment():
    # Check for debugger processes
    # Analyze environment variables
    # Detect debugging files
```
