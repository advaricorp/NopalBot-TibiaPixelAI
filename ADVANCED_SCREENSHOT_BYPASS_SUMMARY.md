   - PIL (most compatible)

### Key Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents detection through timing analysis
- **Method Selection**: Automatically chooses most successful method
- **Performance Statistics**: Tracks success rates and timing
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation to simpler methods

## 🎮 Tibia-Specific Features

### Window Detection
- Automatic Tibia window discovery
- Region-specific capture
- Anti-cheat bypass optimization

### Memory Analysis
- Understanding Tibia's rendering pipeline
- Direct graphics card access
- Hardware acceleration support

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Adaptive Method Selection
```python
# Automatically selects best method based on performance
best_method = bypass.get_best_method()
# Current best: "windows_graphics" with 100% success rate
```

### Performance Statistics
```python
# Real-time performance tracking
stats = bypass.get_performance_stats()
# windows_graphics: 100.0% success rate
# directx: 0.0% success (fallback available)
```

### Capture Optimization
- **Interval**: 100ms between captures (configurable)
- **Memory**: Efficient numpy array handling
- **Speed**: Sub-100ms capture times
- **Reliability**: Multiple fallback methods

## 🔍 Anti-Cheat Evasion

### Detection Avoidance
1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents timing-based detection
