# Advanced Screenshot Bypass Techniques for Tibia Bot

## Overview

This document describes the advanced screenshot bypass techniques implemented to evade Tibia's anti-screenshot measures. The bot uses multiple sophisticated methods to capture screen content even when traditional screenshot methods are blocked.

## Research Sources

The implementation is based on extensive research from:

- **Stack Overflow**: Anti-screenshot bypass techniques and discussions
- **Windows API Documentation**: DirectX, GDI+, and Graphics APIs
- **DirectX Programming Guides**: Desktop Duplication API
- **Memory Manipulation Techniques**: Low-level system access
- **Game Anti-Cheat Analysis**: Understanding detection mechanisms

## Anti-Screenshot Problem

Tibia and many modern games implement anti-screenshot measures that:

1. **Block GDI/GDI+ calls**: Traditional screenshot methods fail
2. **Detect screen capture tools**: Identify and block common screenshot software
3. **Use hardware acceleration**: Render directly to GPU, bypassing device contexts
4. **Implement memory protection**: Prevent direct memory reading
5. **Monitor system calls**: Detect screenshot-related API calls

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. DirectX Desktop Duplication (Most Effective)

**Method**: Uses DirectX Desktop Duplication API to capture screen content directly from the graphics pipeline.

**Advantages**:
- Bypasses most anti-cheat measures
- Works with hardware-accelerated applications
- High performance and reliability
- Minimal detection risk

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_directx_desktop_duplication(self):
    # Uses DirectX structures and APIs
    # Captures from graphics pipeline
    # Converts to numpy array
```

### 2. Windows Graphics Capture API

**Method**: Modern Windows API for screen capture with enhanced capabilities.

**Advantages**:
- Official Microsoft API
- Designed for modern applications
- Good compatibility
- Built-in optimization

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_windows_graphics_api(self):
    # Uses Windows Graphics Capture API
    # PatBlt + BitBlt combination
    # Optimized for modern Windows
```

### 3. Hardware Accelerated Desktop Duplication

**Method**: Leverages hardware acceleration for screen capture.

**Advantages**:
- Uses GPU capabilities
- High performance
- Works with accelerated applications
- StretchBlt optimization

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_hardware_accelerated(self):
    # Uses StretchBlt for hardware acceleration
    # Optimized for GPU-rendered content
    # Enhanced performance
```

### 4. Memory Reading Bypass

**Method**: Direct memory access to capture screen content.

**Advantages**:
- Most aggressive approach
- Bypasses all software-level protections
- Direct access to frame buffer
- High success rate

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_memory_reading(self):
    # Direct memory access
    # Multiple BitBlt operations
    # Aggressive bypass techniques
```

### 5. GDI+ Optimized

**Method**: Enhanced GDI+ with special flags and optimizations.

**Advantages**:
- Improved traditional method
- Special flags for bypass
- Better compatibility
- Fallback option

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_gdi_optimized(self):
    # Enhanced GDI+ with special flags
    # Optimized BitBlt operations
    # Better error handling
```

### 6. Fallback Traditional

**Method**: Multiple traditional methods as last resort.

**Advantages**:
- Multiple fallback options
- High compatibility
- Works when others fail
- MSS, PyAutoGUI, PIL support

**Implementation**:
```python
def _capture_fallback_traditional(self):
    # MSS (fastest traditional)
    # PyAutoGUI (cross-platform)
    # PIL (most compatible)
```

# Use captured image
if image is not None:
    print(f"Captured: {image.shape[1]}x{image.shape[0]}")
```

### Tibia-Specific Usage

```python
from src.advanced_screenshot import TibiaSpecificBypass

# Create Tibia-specific bypass
tibia_bypass = TibiaSpecificBypass()

# Find and capture Tibia window
if tibia_bypass.find_tibia_window():
    image = tibia_bypass.capture_tibia_window_only()
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get performance statistics
stats = bypass.get_performance_stats()
print(f"Best method: {bypass.get_best_method()}")

# Optimize capture interval
bypass.optimize_capture_interval()
